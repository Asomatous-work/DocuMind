Introduction\nn recent years, digital technologies have \nincreasingly contributed to economic \ngrowth and citizen empowerment. \nThese \ntechnologies \nhave \nbecome \nubiquitous in everyday life and enable \npeople to access various services from the \ncomfort of their homes. Government has \nestablished web presence through multiple \nwebsites, web portals, web applications and \nmobile apps that oﬀer information and services \nto the public. However, inconsistency in \nconventions, \nlayout \nstandards, \nnavigation \nstrategies and technologies adopted can \nreduce the eﬀectiveness of websites/apps.\nIn this context, the National Informatics Centre \n(NIC) formulated the Guidelines for Indian \nGovernment Websites (GIGW) in the year 2009. \nGIGW aims to ensure quality and accessibility of \ngovernment guidelines, by oﬀering guidance \non desirable practices covering the entire \nlifecycle of websites, web portals and web \napplications, right from conceptualisation and \ndesign to their development, maintenance and \nmanagement. \nThe \nDepartment \nof \nAdministrative Reforms and Public Grievances \nmade the same a part of the Central Secretariat \nManual of Oﬃce Procedure. \nThe second version of GIGW (GIGW 2.0) was \ndeveloped in 2019, taking into account \nfeedback from and consultations with industry, \nI\nIntroduction\n1.0\n7\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n1. Introduction\nsociety and government organisations. GIGW \n2.0 took note of the standards evolved by \ninternational bodies like the world-wide web \nconsortium (W3C) and advancements in \ntechnology. It also included guidance on mobile \napps. \nThis version is the third version of GIGW (GIGW \n3.0). While the earlier versions were formulated \nin-house with external inputs, GIGW 3.0 has \nbeen formulated jointly with Standardisation \nTesting \nand \nQuality \nCertiﬁcation \n(STQC) \nDirectorate of the Ministry of Electronics and \nInformation Technology and Indian Computer \nEmergency Response Team (CERT-In), so that \nthe experience of conformity with GIGW \ngathered by the STQC Directorate auditors and \nthe cybersecurity experience and knowledge of \nCERT-In also inform the GIGW. As in earlier \nversions, GIGW 3.0 too has also been formulated \nin association with industry and experts.\nThe key thrust of GIGW 3.0 is on oﬀering speciﬁc \nguidance to government organisations on how \nto improve the user interface and user \nexperience (UI and UX), by incorporating \nfeatures such as intuitive page loading (using AI \nand analytics) based on user journey and user \nproﬁle, \nusing \nstate-of-the-art \ncontent \nmanagement \nsystem \n(CMS), \nuser-centric \ninformation \narchitecture \n(IA), \ncentralised \nmonitoring dashboard to identify and provide \nalerts \non \nnon-conformity \nand \ntechnical \nenablement of all content creators and \npublishers.\nGIGW 3.0 also signiﬁcantly enhances the \nguidance on the accessibility and usability of \nmobile apps, especially by oﬀering speciﬁc \nguidance to government organisations on how \nto leverage public digital infrastructure devised \nfor whole-of-government delivery of services, \nbeneﬁts and information. These cover aspects \nsuch as API level integration for use of \nintegration with social media, India Portal, \nDigiLocker, Aadhaar-based identity, single \nsign-on, data sharing in open formats on the \ngovernment’s data platform, government’s \nscheme discovery platform, government’s \ncitizen engagement platform MyGov, AI-based \nIndian language translation tools, seamless \ncontent/data \naccess \nacross \nweb-based \nsolutions of government organisations. GIGW \n3.0 oﬀers upgraded guidelines on accessibility \nof websites and apps, with a view to make \naccess to cyberspace more inclusive. In view of \nincorporation of comprehensive guidance in \nthis version on apps as well (in addition to \nwebsites), this version is titled “Guidelines for \nIndian \nGovernment Websites \nand \nApps”. \nHowever, since the acronym GIGW gained wide \ncurrency, the acronym has been retained, with \nthe letter “W” being signifying “Websites and \nApps”.\nA chapter on cybersecurity, formulated by \nCERT-In, has also been incorporated so that \nGIGW can serve as a single point of reference on \nall the relevant aspects — quality, accessibility \nand security — relating to websites, web \nportals, web applications and mobile apps. \nSince cybersecurity requirements undergo \ncontinuous evolution in light of emerging \nthreat \nscenarios, \nthreat \nvectors \nand \ntechnologies, \nCERT-In \ncontinuously \nissues \nupdated guidance and advisories to address the \n8\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nsame. Such guidance and advisories issued by \nCERT-In from time to time should be treated as \nupdates to the guidance contained in the \nchapter on cybersecurity and any assessments \nor audit carried out with reference to GIGW 3.0 \nshould also be cognizant of the same. Further, \nwhile government organisations may continue \nto establish conformity with GIGW 3.0 by \nobtaining Certiﬁed Quality Website (CQW) \ncertiﬁcation from the STQC Directorate, the \ncertiﬁcation of cybersecurity aspects by STQC \nmay be done on the basis of the “safe to host” \ncertiﬁcate issued by the cybersecurity auditors \nempanelled by CERT-In/STQC or the auditors of \nSTQC or NIC.\nTo make the guidelines more readily usable, \nwhich entity/person has a role in implementing \na particular guideline has been identiﬁed in \nevery guideline. Thus, each guideline speciﬁes \nwhether the same is to be acted upon by the \ngovernment organisation concerned or the \ndeveloper or the evaluators.\nThe eﬀectiveness of GIGW 3.0 in enhancing ease \nof living through various web-based initiatives \nof the government would depend on their \neﬀective implementation in letter and spirit by \nall \ngovernment \norganisations \nand \ntheir \nimplementation \nand \nevaluation \npartners. \nGovernment organisations are expected to \ncarefully assess their existing websites, web \nportals, web applications and mobile apps \nagainst GIGW 3.0, identify areas requiring \nimprovement, \ndraw \nup \ntime \nbound \nimplementation plans to achieve conformity \nwith GIGW 3.0 and obtain CQW certiﬁcation \nfrom the STQC Directorate. Similarly, websites, \nweb portals, web applications and mobile apps \nthat are at the design or implementation stage \nmay also be reviewed to ensure that their \ndesign, architecture, development and scope of \naudit conform to GIGW 3.0 and requisite \napprovals, resources etc. are tied up to ensure \nthis.\nWhile GIGW embodies general guidance for \ngovernment websites, web portals, web \napplications and mobile apps, particular \nwebsite/app use cases may require adoption of \nhigher \nnorms \nand \nspeciﬁc \ntechnologies. \nGovernment organisations may keep this in \nmind \nwhile \nformulating \ntheir \ndesign, \narchitecture and scope and may consult NIC in \ncase they desire technical advice in the matter.\n1.

Scope and objective\nThese guidelines have been framed with the objective to make the government websites/apps \nconform to the essential prerequisites of the UUU trilogy of usability, user-centricity and universal \naccessibility.\nThese guidelines are based on international standards, including ISO 23026, W3C’s Web Content \nAccessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, as well as the \nInformation Technology Act, 2000. Further, the long-standing experience of the authors in the \ndesign, development and management of government websites/apps as well as their knowledge of \nthe ground realities and challenges faced by government organisations in developing and \nmanaging their websites/apps, have helped signiﬁcantly in drafting these guidelines.\nThese guidelines also form the basis for obtaining the Website Quality Certiﬁcation from the STQC \nDirectorate. \nDetails \nof \nthe \ncertiﬁcation \nscheme \nare \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.stqc.gov.in/website-quality-certiﬁcation-0.\nThese guidelines are being circulated amongst all Indian government organisations at all levels \n(Central, State and district/local). These should be followed and implemented on priority so that \nthe overall aim of making all Indian government websites/apps citizen-focused and user-friendly \nmay be realised.\nConformity to guidelines\n2.1\nGovernment organisations are expected to read, understand and implement these guidelines on all \nof their web-based initiatives. In other words, all the websites/apps owned by government \norganisations must comply with these guidelines. It is recommended that browser-based intranet \napplications should also follow these guidelines. Depending upon their speciﬁc requirements, \ngovernment organisations may draw up short-term and long-term timebound implementation \nplans for achieving conformity with these guidelines.\nHow to use GIGW 3.0\n2.2\n13\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nNew \nfeatures \nof GIGW 3.0\n\u001c\u001e\nGUIDELINES FOR INDIAN GOVERNMENT \nWEBSITES AND APPS\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n3    New features of GIGW 3.0\n      3.1    Structure\n      3.2   Quality\n      3.3   Accessibility\n      3.4   Cybersecurity\n      3.5   Lifecycle management\n      3.6   Risk factors and their mitigation\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n3.

This version was reorganised to ease adoption and \nimplementation and ensure wider conformity with GIGW. The following major \nenhancements have been included in the current version.\nThe new version of the guidelines is structured so as to reduce ambiguity and provide clarity on the \nroles and responsibilities of the implementers. The guidelines are structured under the following \nheads:\n(a) Statement: Requirement or checkpoint to\nmeet the particular guideline.\n(b) Beneﬁts: Positive outcomes achieved by\nfollowing the requirements, such as improving\nuser experience, accessibility, security and\ntrust-building with citizens.\n(c) Government organisation action: Actions\npertaining \nto \nthe \nowner \ngovernment\norganisation.
